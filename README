This version of online photometric calibration subscribes to an image topic, takes a text file of gt exp times and publishes a photometrically corrected image.
This does not use the rapid exposure estimator.

To run.

First 
Make sure your directory for the times.txt file is corrected inside test2.cpp
Next set your directory for the images inside image pub

Now rosrun package_name test2
and Next rosrun package_name image_pub
